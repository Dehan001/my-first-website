  In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
  prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for <small>CERN researchers</small> to use and
  share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
  hypertext system.[4] <em>Berners-Lee</em> specified HTML and wrote the browser
  and server software in <strong>late 1990</strong>. That year, Berners-Lee and
  CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
  funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal
  notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext
  is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]

  The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML
  Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
  1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple
  design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced
  by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based
  documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML
  4.[9]
